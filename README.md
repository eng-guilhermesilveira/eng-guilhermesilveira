- 👋 Hi, I'm @eng-guilhermesilveira, a Brazilian Structural Engineer who loves technology.
- 👀 I'm interested in taking the AECO industry to another level.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python, C#, ThreeJS, and AI fundamentals.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source BIM solutions, applied structural programs, and commercial solutions for the industry.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Coffee, cats, nature trails, and calisthenics make me happy :)
